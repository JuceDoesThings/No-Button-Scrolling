# No Button Scrolling

A simple mod that fixes that pesky text scrolling introduced in 1.19.4

## Usage

Pretty straightforward! This mod was originally made for Quilt, but it should work on Fabric and with the newer versions as they come out with little to no changes. I mean... it's one mixin, how badly could I have screwed up, right?
